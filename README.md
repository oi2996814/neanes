## Features

- WYSIWYG design
- Rapid entry of neumes and lyrics
- Automatic alignment of supporting neumes (i.e. fthoras, accidentals, klasmas, gorgons, et al)
- Automatic calculation of martyria
- Print or export to PDF

## Purpose

This software is intended to create simple scores that contain:

- A title
- A mode signature
- Neumes and lyrics

It is not intended to be a fully-featured word processor.

## Examples

Example files can be found in the [examples](examples/) folder.

## How to Download

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/danielgarthur/neanes/releases) and download the setup EXE from the latest release.

## How-to Guide

### Create a new score

To create a new score, use the file menu: `File -> New`. This will give you a template containing a title and a mode key.

### Update the title

To update the title, click on it and begin typing. While editing the title, a toolbar will appear at the bottom of the window. This toolbar can be used to change the size, color, font, and alignment of the text.

### Update the mode key

To update the mode key, double click the current mode key to open the mode key dialog. You can also launch the dialog by clicking the mode key once, and pressing `Change Key` in the toolbar at the bottom of the window.

In the mode key dialog, select the mode on the left, and then pick the appropriate signature on the right. Most common signatures should be present in the dialog. Many signatures can be written in several different ways, and not all variations have been included. If a signature is missing, request it by opening an issue.

While the mode key is selected, a toolbar at the bottom the screen will be visible that allows you to change the color, size, and alignment of the key.

### Entering Neumes

Quantitative neumes are inserted by clicking the desired neume in the panel on the left side of the window. Supporting such as fthoras, gorgons, accidentals, etc. can be inserted by using the toolbar that appears on the bottom of the screen when a neume is selected.

To insert a martyria, use the martyria button in toolbar on the top of the window. The note and root sign of the martyria are automatically calculated based on the mode key and fthoras placed above neumes. If the melody leaves the range generally used by traditional Byzantine Chant, the martyria will not display properly.

To insert a tempo marker, click the desired marker in the toolbar on the top of the window.

### Entry Modes

There are three modes of neume entry.

- Auto Mode
- Insert Mode
- Single Edit Mode

To change the entry mode, click the `Auto`, `Insert`, or `Single` buttons in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

#### Auto Mode

When creating a new score, you will most likely want to use Auto Mode. In Auto Mode, clicking a quantitative neume will advance the cursor to the right and set the neume. When a supporting neume is clicked, such as a gorgon or a fthora, the neume will be added to the currently selected neume, without advancing the cursor.

This mode allows you to quickly enter neumes by clicking the quantitative neumes in left panel. You can either enter all the quantitative neumes rapidly, and then go back and add the gorgon, fthora, etc., or you can click a quantitative neume, click the gorgon, click another quantitative neume, etc.

If you make a mistake, and wish to go back a character, press the left arrow key to move the cursor back to the left and continue entering neumes. The mistake will be overwritten.

#### Insert Mode

If you need to insert neumes in the middle of the score, then you should use Insert Mode. This mode functions similarly to Auto Mode, except neumes are not overwritten, but are instead inserted to the right of the current cursor position.

#### Single Edit Mode

In Single Edit Mode, clicking a quantitative neume updates the currently selected neume without advancing the cursor. This can be used to correct a single mistake by clicking directly on the neume and changing it.

### Removing Neumes and Other Elements

To remove a neume, text box, or mode key, select it and press the delete button in the main toolbar.

### Inserting Lyrics

To insert lyrics, click on the space just below a neume and begin typing.

- To move to the next lyric box, press `Space`, `Tab`, or `Ctrl + Right Arrow`.
- To insert an actual space character, press `Ctrl + Space`.
- To move to the previous lyric box, press `Ctrl + Left Arrow`.
- If you press the `Left Arrow` key while the cursor is at the beginning of a lyric box, then the cursor will move to the previous lyric box.
- If you press the `Right Arrow` key while the cursor is at the end of a lyric box, then the cursor will move to the next lyric box.

#### Melismas

To create a melisma, end your lyrics with an underscore (`_`). To continue the melisma, set the lyrics for each neume in the melisma to a single underscore. The full melisma will be drawn for you.

### Page Breaks and Line Breaks

To insert a page break or a line break, click the neume that you want the break to occur after, and press the `Page Break` or `Line Break` button in the toolbar at the top of the window. To remove the page or line break, highlight the element with the break, and press the button page or line break button again.

### Drop Caps

Drop Caps may be inserted through the main menu by clicking `Insert -> Drop Cap`.

### Saving the score

The application will automatically save your work as you go to a temporary cache. If you close the application and re-open, your previous score with unsaved changes will be restored.

It is best, however, to save the file to a disk using the main menu. Click `File -> Save` or `File -> Save As`.

### Export to PDF

To export the score to PDF, click `File -> Export to PDF` in the main menu.

### Print

To print, click `File -> Print` in the main menu.
